 * Move fsat instructions closer to the source when it is likely to be
 * profitable.
 *
 * Intel GPUs have a saturate destination modifier, and
 * brw_fs_opt_saturate_propagation tries to replace explicit saturate
 * operations with this destination modifier. That pass is limited in several
 * ways. If the source of the explicit saturate is in a different block or if
 * the source of the explicit saturate is live after the explicit saturate,
 * brw_fs_opt_saturate_propagation will be unable to make progress.
 *
 * This optimization exists to help brw_fs_opt_saturate_propagation make more
 * progress. It tries to move NIR fsat instructions to the same block that
 * contains the definition of its source. It does this only in cases where it
 * will not create additional live values. It also attempts to do this only in
 * cases where the explicit saturate will ultimiately be converted to a
 * destination modifier.
 *
 * The optimization scans all instructions. For each fsat instruction found,
 * the optimization operates 4 main steps:
 *
 * 1. Find the source of the fsat instruction. If the source is an ALU
 *    instruction, add it a worklist called Sources. This occurs in the
 *    function \c collect_reaching_defs.
 *
 * 2. Process the Sources worklist. Iterate the uses of each instruction on
 *    the worklist. If a use is a fsat instruction or a phi node, add the
 *    instruction to a set of instructions to be "fixed up" in step 3, below.
 *    If a use is a phi node, add its uses to the worklist. If a use is
 *    neither a fsat instruction nor a phi node, return failure. This
 *    indicates that there is some path from one of the definitions to a use
 *    that is not fsat. This occurs in the function \c verify_users.
 *
 * 3. For each instruction in the "fix up" set created in step 2 that is not
 *    an fsat, insert a new fsat instruction immediately following it.
 *    Replace all uses of instruction with the new fsat.
 *
 * 4. Convert the old fsat instruction to a simple move instruction. This can
 *    be eliminated by other optimizations.
 *
 * If there are many fsat users of a particular instruction, the algorithm
 * will only perform step 3 for the first encountered fsat. Each fsat
 * encountered later will detect that it is an fsat of an fsat (with the
 * latter in a different basic block). Step 4 ensures that each fsat
 * encountered later will still be eliminated.
 *
 * \note This optimization could find even more fsat instructions to move by
 * walking "up" the phi web in step 1. If the source of the fsat is a phi
 * node, repeatedly iterate through the phi web to find all of the reaching
 * definitions.
 *
 * This has already been implemented. Unfortunately, moving some fsat
 * instructions in some large ray tracing shaders in fossil-db causes the
 * scheduler and register allocator to make bad choices. This results in
 * additional spills and fills.
