/* The pass uses information on which branches are divergent in order to
 * determine which blocks are "reconvergence points" where parked threads may
 * become reactivated as well as to add "physical" edges where the machine may
 * fall through to the next reconvergence point. Reconvergence points need a
 * (jp) added in the assembly, and physical edges are needed to model shared
 * register liveness correctly. Reconvergence happens in the following two
 * scenarios:
 *
 * 1. When there is a divergent branch, the later of the two block destinations
 *    becomes a reconvergence point.
 * 2. When a forward edge crosses over a reconvergence point that may be
 *    outstanding at the start of the edge, we need to park the threads that
 *    take the edge and resume execution at the reconvergence point. This means
 *    that there is a physical edge from the start of the edge to the
 *    reconvergence point, and the destination of the edge becomes a new
 *    reconvergence point.
 *
 * For example, consider this simple if-else:
 *
 *    bb0:
 *    ...
 *    br p0.x, #bb1, #bb2
 *    bb1:
 *    ...
 *    jump bb3
 *    bb2:
 *    ...
 *    jump bb3
 *    bb3:
 *    ...
 *
 * The divergent branch at the end of bb0 makes bb2 a reconvergence point
 * following (1), which starts being outstanding after the branch at the end of
 * bb1. The jump to bb3 at the end of bb1 goes over bb2 while it is outstanding,
 * so there is a physical edge from bb1 to bb2 and bb3 is a reconvergence point
 * following (2).
 * 
 * Note that (2) can apply recursively. To handle this efficiently we build an
 * interval tree of forward edges that cross other blocks and whenever a block
 * becomes a RP we iterate through the edges jumping across it using the tree.
 * We also need to keep track of the range where each RP may be
 * "outstanding." A RP becomes outstanding after a branch to it parks its
 * threads there. This range may increase in size as we discover more and more
 * branches to it that may park their threads there.
 *
 * Finally, we need to compute the branchstack value, which is the maximum
 * number of outstanding reconvergence points. For the if-else, the branchstack
 * is 2, because after the jump at the end of bb2 both reconvergence points are
 * outstanding (although the first is removed immediately afterwards). Because
 * we already computed the range where each RP is outstanding, this part is
 * relatively straightforward.
